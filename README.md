----------------------
This application allows users to discover the most popular movies playing.

The user can change the sort order via the Settings menu.

To run this application, an API key should be obtained from theMovieDB API.
If you donâ€™t already have an account, you will need to [create one](https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup&sa=D&ust=1493570763652000&usg=AFQjCNEmpw7a1RQpelnxklbRDmmVaB4LgQ) in order to request an API Key.

Once you obtain your key, include it in the build by adding the following line to `[USER_HOME]/.gradle/gradle.properties`
